Configure Azure Storage firewalls and virtual networks

Azure Storage provides a layered security model. 
This model enables you to secure your storage accounts to a specific set of supported networks. 
When network rules are configured, only applications requesting data from over the specified 
set of networks can access a storage account.

An application that accesses a storage account when network rules are in effect requires proper 
authorization on the request. Authorization is supported with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) 
credentials for blobs and queues, with a valid account access key, or with an SAS token.
